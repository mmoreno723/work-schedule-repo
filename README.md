## Work Scheduler

## Description
This application is designed to be a dynamically updated work scheduler. A user may log events that they need to complete in the allocated time blocks on the screen. Upon viewing the work scheduler, the current time will be shown at the top. The corresponding time block (in business hours) will be illuminated to show what the current time block is. Any events in the past will be illuminated grey and any future events will be illuminated green. Once a user enters an input in the text area, the item will be saved to the screen. This application primarily uses Javascript and other jQuery elements. 

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "work-scheduler" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

## Usage 
You may use this to keep track of any events you have going on throughout your day. Upon opening the application, type anything you would like to get donw in the corresponding time block. Click save and your event will be saved to the screen.
